                    This extraterrestrial entity made its way to Earth approximately 50 years ago.
                    Originating from the distant planet Synthara, this alien species, known as Cognitron, 
                    has insidiously infiltrated our Earth. Our intelligence agents, from the Alien Extermination Society (AES), 
                    that infiltrated the Syntharians' secret base has unveiled a sinister motiveâ€”Cognitron's mission is to 
                    corrupt and manipulate our AI technologies, turning them against humanity. A single Cognitron 
                    possesses the capability to thoroughly corrupt and dismantle our technological infrastructure, 
                    making swift action imperative.

                    <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature:</span> 
                    Exercise extreme caution and refrain from engaging with this malevolent entity for an extended duration! 
                    In the event of encountering this nefarious creature, promptly report the incident to the Alien Extermination Society (AES). 
                    Swift action is crucial, as AES operatives will swiftly arrive equipped with specialized blue light technology to eliminate the threat.
